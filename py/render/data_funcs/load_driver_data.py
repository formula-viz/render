"""Car Data Processing Module.

This module processes telemetry data from Formula 1 qualifying sessions to extract car movement,
position, and speed data for visualization and analysis purposes. It handles downloading driver
images, processing telemetry data, generating smooth interpolated paths, adding buffer frames
before and after laps, calculating car rotations, and validating track limits.

Main functionality includes:
- Loading F1 telemetry data via FastF1 API
- Standardizing start/finish lines across drivers
- Generating smooth car paths using spline interpolation
- Adding realistic car rotations and wheel rotations
- Ensuring cars stay within track limits
- Saving processed data for later visualization

The processed data can be used to create 3D visualizations of qualifying laps.

    Calculates two sets of quaternion rotations for the car:

    2. "Harsher" rotations with less smoothing for more responsive cornering visualization

    The rotations are calculated by looking ahead at future positions and creating
